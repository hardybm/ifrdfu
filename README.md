 Ben's little list of ways to avoid PIFR disasters

## Just a personal repo of rules of thumb

Required descent rate = Groundspeed (kts) * 5 #for three degree descent
Top of descent point = thousands to lose * 3
(for example, Need to get to 3000, currently at 10,000. 7,000 to loose, 7*3 = 21 = start your 3 degree descent at 21 miles out)
