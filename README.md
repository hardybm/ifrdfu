# ifrdfu
 Ben's little list of ways to avoid PIFR disasters. Just a personal repo of rules of thumb

### rules of thumb
- Required descent rate = Groundspeed (kts) * 5 #for three degree descent
- Top of descent point = thousands to lose * 3
-- (for example, Need to get to 3000, currently at 10,000. 7,000 to loose, 7*3 = 21 = start your 3 degree descent at 21 miles out)

### Speeds

|Segment|Speed(kt)|
|---|---|
|Initial|90-150|
|Final|70-100|
|Circling|100|
|Missed|110|


### Standard transponder codes
2000 IFR in G until you have clearance

3000 VFR in D, or IFR in E (rare)

### Recency
61.920  Limitations on exercise of privileges of private instrument ratingsâ€”recent experience
- To fly IFR you need to have flown IFR within 6 months
- To do an approach you need to have done an approach within 6 months
