# ifrdfu
 Ben's little list of ways to avoid PIFR disasters. Just a personal repo of rules of thumb

### rules of thumb
Required descent rate = Groundspeed (kts) * 5 #for three degree descent

Top of descent point = thousands to lose * 3

(for example, Need to get to 3000, currently at 10,000. 7,000 to loose, 7*3 = 21 = start your 3 degree descent at 21 miles out)

### Standard transponder codes
2000 IFR in G until you have clearance

3000 VFR in D, or IFR in E (rare)

### Recency
Must have completed a flight under the IFR within the previous 6 months which went for 1 hour and had 1 instrument approach.
