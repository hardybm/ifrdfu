 Ben's little list of ways to avoid PIFR disasters. Just a personal repo of rules of thumb

### rules of thumb
- Required descent rate = Groundspeed (kts) * 5 #for three degree descent
- Top of descent point = thousands to lose * 3
-- (for example, Need to get to 3000, currently at 10,000. 7,000 to loose, 7*3 = 21 = start your 3 degree descent at 21 miles out)

### Speeds (Cat A)

|Segment|Speed(kt)|
|---|---|
|Initial|90-150|
|Final|70-100|
|Circling (1.68 nm)|100|
|Missed|110|


### Standard transponder codes

|code|meaning|
|---|---|
|1200|VFR|
|2000|IFR in G on startup|
|3000|VFR in D, or IFR in E (rare)|
|7600|Com fail|
